Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves building a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset consists of over 280,000 transactions, with a highly imbalanced class distribution. Key tasks include:

	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling imbalanced data using undersampling, and scaling features for optimal model performance.
	•	Model Training: Implemented Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning to improve convergence.
	•	Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy in detecting fraud, leveraging advanced techniques like feature scaling and solver optimization.

The data was acquired from Kaggels credit card fraud detection challenge
